#+title: DOTFILES

Hello, this repo holds my configurations for my linux laptops! I am currently
running Arco Linux on my primary laptop and a mircosoft surface. If you are
looking for my old ubuntu rices, check out the =ubuntu-qtile= branch of this
repo.

I am using [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][Catppuccin Frappe]] for my primary system-theme.

Most of this software is in the Arco repositories or on the AUR so installation
should be reasonably easy. I will be converting most of my actual dotfiles into
=org= documents which will tangle into the actual configuration, which will allow
me to discuss any tricky or confusing parts of the customization.
