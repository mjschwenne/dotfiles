#+title: DOTFILES

This is an old setup from when I was running Arco Linux and BSPWM.
It is preserved for posterity.

I am using [[https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin][Catppuccin Frappe]] for my primary system-theme.

Most of this software is in the Arco repositories or on the AUR so installation
should be reasonably easy. I will be converting most of my actual dotfiles into
=org= documents which will tangle into the actual configuration, which will allow
me to discuss any tricky or confusing parts of the customization.
